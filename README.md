# Assembly Lab
This is a lab aimed at gaining an understanding on how assembly language can be used to create programs that can run on PIC16F877A microcontroller.

The files are as follows:
 Add2Number - This is the first practice file. It looks at addition using assembly.
 
TurnLedOn - This is the second practice file. It looks at writing a program that can turn on an LED at one of the ports in the PIC16F877A.

blinkClockCycle - This is the third practice file. It looks at how a delay can be used to have an LED turn on and off.

lab1Main - this is the lab file looking at how to turn on two LEDs simultaneously then after a while, blink them alternately.
